Here are three fun facts for you:

Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren’t!
Botanically, bananas qualify as berries because they develop from a single flower with one ovary. Strawberries, on the other hand, come from a flower with multiple ovaries, so they don’t make the berry cut!

Octopuses have three hearts!
Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Fun twist: the heart that pumps blood to the body stops beating when they swim.

A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus!
Venus takes about 243 Earth days to complete one full rotation (a day) but only 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun (a year).
