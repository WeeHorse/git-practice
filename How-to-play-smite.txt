Here are three fun facts for you:

Bananas are berries, but strawberries arenâ€™t!
Botanically, bananas qualify as berries because they develop from a single flower with one ovary. Strawberries, on the other hand, come from a flower with multiple ovaries, so they donâ€™t make the berry cut!

Octopuses have three hearts!
Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Fun twist: the heart that pumps blood to the body stops beating when they swim.

A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus!
Venus takes about 243 Earth days to complete one full rotation (a day) but only 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun (a year).

The best Smite tactic depends on your role, god selection, and the situation in the game. However, here are some universally strong Smite strategies to dominate:

1. Communicate and Coordinate
Early-game invades: Coordinate with your team for early jungle invasions to steal buffs and set the enemy Jungler behind. Gods with strong level-1 abilities (e.g., Ymir or Thor) can secure kills and gain momentum.
Call objectives: Use pings and chat to direct attention to key objectives like Gold Fury and Fire Giant. Grouping for these can shift the game in your favor.
2. Play Around Timings
Buff control: Know when buffs respawn (e.g., jungle camps every 2 minutes). Secure your buffs while contesting enemy camps when possible.
Objective timers: Gold Fury and Fire Giant spawn timers are critical. Ward them proactively to prevent enemy steals or to set up ambushes.
3. Positioning and Crowd Control
Team fights: Protect your backline as a support or frontliner, focusing on peeling for your damage dealers. If you're a carry, position well to avoid diving enemies.
Use CC effectively: Gods with stuns, roots, or slows (e.g., Ares, Athena) can dictate team fights. Chain CC for easy kills.
4. Split Push When Necessary
If you're falling behind or need to relieve pressure, a solo laner or assassin can push lanes while the rest of the team distracts the enemy. This forces the enemy to split their focus.
5. Secure Objectives with Ultimates
Some gods have incredible secure potential for big objectives. If you're playing a god like Kukulkan or Poseidon, save your ultimate to guarantee the last hit on Gold Fury, Pyromancer, or Fire Giant.
